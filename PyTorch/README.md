# Introduction to PyTorch by Arju Srivastava
This repository contains a comprehensive introduction to PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The materials are designed to help beginners get started with PyTorch and understand its core concepts and functionalities.

## What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes:
- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.
- An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks. 
- (Iska mtlb yeh hai ki yeh humko neural networks banane mein madad karta hai aur yeh GPU ka use karke computations ko fast karta hai)

### Goal of this tutorial:
Understand PyTorch’s Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.
Train a small neural network to classify images
